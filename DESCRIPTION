Description:
    Provides a modular toolkit for analysing Indian stocks with live NSE 
    fundamentals, Yahoo Finance price data, technical indicators, financial 
    ratios, and Buffett-style valuation models. Functions support data 
    retrieval from NSE public JSON endpoints, web scraping of fundamentals, 
    price history collection, and computation of intrinsic value. The package 
    also embeds a multi-tab Shiny dashboard under inst/shiny/stockApp with 
    modules for market overview, price exploration, fundamentals, screeners, 
    intrinsic valuation, and portfolio tracking. Designed for rapid prototyping, 
    investment analysis, and educational use in quantitative finance.
